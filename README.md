🛠️ Useful Commands & Scripts

This repository is a personal collection of commands, scripts, notebooks and snippets I use on a daily basis.
It serves as a quick reference to avoid re-googling the same things over and over.

💻 Environment

Most of the commands and scripts here are used on Ubuntu Linux.
In general, they should also work on macOS, but you may need minor adjustments (different package managers, paths, or system utilities).

📂 Structure

All command related topics are contained within their own Markdown files.
 - `commands\` -> Collection of commands
 - `scripts\` -> Collection of scripts
 - `configs\` -> Collection of configurations
 - `notebooks\` -> Collection of Jupyter notebooks

🔍 How to use

Browse by folder/topic.
Copy-paste snippets directly, or adapt them to your workflow.
Most scripts are safe to run as-is, but review before executing on your system.
