That's okay, I understand. How can I assist you today? I can help with a wide range of tasks! Whether you need information, want to learn something new, need assistance with a project, or just want to have a conversation, feel free to let me know how I can assist you. I'm here to help! That's great to know. I actually have a question about a programming concept. I'm curious about how recursion works in programming. Could you explain it to me? Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain recursion in programming!\\n\\nRecursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, a recursive function is a function that calls itself one or more times in its body. Usually, this is the most natural way to express the algorithm used to solve a problem.\\n\\nHere are the key points about recursion:\\n\\n1. **Base Case**: This is the condition under which the recursion stops. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop and eventually causing a stack overflow error.\", additional_kwargs={}, raw=None, logprobs=None, delta=None)"
